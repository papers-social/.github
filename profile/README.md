# [papers.social](papers.social)

(_Hopefully_) A place where people can discover new papers, publicly review them,
and talk about them.

The project's mission is as follows:

> Build a sibling project to [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/). Research should be open,
> and the internet can be leveraged for good to disseminate discoveries and innovations.
> The goal is to expose researchers, scientists, engineers, academics, and other members
> of the public to works that they would have otherwise never seen, and allow them to
> review and discuss each others' work. This can hopefully foster new connections between
> different fields of research, spark new interdisciplinary work, help researchers learn
> from other areas, and help everyone keep each other accountable.

## What's been done?

> [!NOTE]
> Everything is a WIP (isn't almost everything so?)
