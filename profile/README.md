# [papers.social](http://papers.social)

(_Hopefully_) A place where people can discover new papers, publicly review them,
and talk about them.

The project's mission is as follows:

> Build a sibling project to [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/). Research should be open,
> and the internet can be leveraged for good to disseminate discoveries and innovations.
> The goal is to expose researchers, scientists, engineers, academics, and other members
> of the public to works that they would have otherwise never seen, and allow them to
> review and discuss each others' work. This can hopefully foster new connections between
> different fields of research, spark new interdisciplinary work, help researchers learn
> from other areas, and help everyone keep each other accountable.

More on how I (@alanssitis) plan to build it [here (papers-social/design)](https://github.com/papers-social/design).

I started this because I believe a central place to find publications that I'd
like to read would be beneficial as I start grad-school. In my experience, paper
discovery comes mostly from word-of-mouth (figuratively), or stalking publishing
venues and [arXiv](https://arXiv.org) for something that catches my eye.

A side-(non-core)-goal of this project is to also make paper discovery and
sharing more accessible to everyone. This was goal was inspired by
[Bryan Cantrill's keynote at USENIX ATC 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAEiXWO44bQ).
Hopefully this project would not only help eager academics explore work outside
their direct area of expertise, but also attract feedback from folks that live
outside the academic ivory tower. It would be awesome if this could, in turn,
attract more practical work and improve connections in more than one axis.

If you are interested and would like to provide feedback or help out this
project, please reach out! I would love to make this into a proper organization.
